# Task Overview: 
The goal of this assignment is to implement a multi-stage text retrieval pipeline for question-answering tasks, incorporating both embedding models and ranking models. 
You will benchmark different ranking models to assess their impact on retrieval accuracy and understand trade-offs related to model size, accuracy, and performance. 

# Tasks: 
## 1 .Paper: https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2409.07691

### Literature Review and Understanding: 
Read the provided paper thoroughly to understand the concepts of multi-stage text retrieval, embedding models, and ranking models. Summarize the key points, focusing on how ranking models enhance retrieval accuracy in Q&A systems. 

## 2. Dataset Preparation: 

Use publicly available Q&A datasets from the BEIR benchmark, such as Natural Questions (NQ), HotpotQA, and FiQA. Ensure that the datasets are preprocessed appropriately (e.g., chunked into passages, tokenized). 
## 3. Implement the Retrieval Pipeline: 
### 3.A. Stage 1 -
#### Candidate Retrieval:
Select at least two embedding models (one small and one large) that are commercially usable (e.g., sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5). 
Implement the candidate retrieval stage using these embedding models to retrieve the top-k relevant passages for a given query. 
### 3.B. Stage 2 - 
#### Reranking:
Choose at least two ranking models (e.g., cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2 and nvidia/nv-rerankqa-mistral-4b-v3). 
Implement the reranking stage to reorder the retrieved passages based on relevance scores from the ranking models. 
## 4. Benchmarking and Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the retrieval pipeline using metrics like NDCG@10. Compare the retrieval accuracy with and without the ranking models.
Analyze the impact of different embedding and ranking model combinations on retrieval accuracy.

For completing all the tasks outlined in your multi-stage retrieval pipeline project, you will need libraries that can handle **embedding models**, **ranking models**, **dataset preprocessing**, and **evaluation**. Below is a list of the best libraries you can use for each stage of your project:

### 1. **Candidate Retrieval and Reranking**
You’ll need libraries that support pre-trained embedding and ranking models for retrieval tasks.

- **Hugging Face's Transformers**:
  - **Why**: Provides access to a wide range of pre-trained embedding and ranking models, including sentence-transformers and cross-encoders. You can easily implement models like `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`.
  - **Key Functions**: `AutoModel`, `AutoTokenizer`, and `pipeline` for embeddings and reranking.
  - **Installation**: `pip install transformers`
  - **Usage**:
    ```python
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

    # Example: Embedding model
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    ```

- **Sentence-Transformers**:
  - **Why**: Tailored for sentence and passage embeddings. It’s built on top of Hugging Face, with optimized methods for text embeddings, ranking, and similarity searches.
  - **Key Functions**: `SentenceTransformer` for embedding models, `CrossEncoder` for ranking models.
  - **Installation**: `pip install sentence-transformers`
  - **Usage**:
    ```python
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

    # Example: Embedding model
    model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    embeddings = model.encode(["This is a query", "This is a passage"])
    ```

### 2. **Dataset Preparation**
For loading and processing datasets like BEIR benchmarks (Natural Questions, HotpotQA, etc.), these libraries will help:

- **BEIR (Benchmarking Information Retrieval)**:
  - **Why**: BEIR is specifically designed for benchmarking information retrieval models on a wide variety of Q&A datasets like Natural Questions (NQ), HotpotQA, and FiQA.
  - **Key Functions**: `BEIRDataset`, dataset downloading, and passage chunking.
  - **Installation**: `pip install beir`
  - **Usage**:
    ```python
    from beir import util, datasets

    # Load BEIR dataset
    dataset = datasets.load("fiqa")
    ```

- **Datasets (from Hugging Face)**:
  - **Why**: Provides easy access to a variety of Q&A datasets, including those used in BEIR. You can preprocess, tokenize, and chunk passages easily using this library.
  - **Key Functions**: `load_dataset` for loading datasets, `map` for preprocessing and tokenization.
  - **Installation**: `pip install datasets`
  - **Usage**:
    ```python
    from datasets import load_dataset

    # Load dataset
    dataset = load_dataset("natural_questions")
    ```

### 3. **Indexing and Searching (Optional for Candidate Retrieval)**
If your retrieval stage requires efficient passage indexing and searching (especially for larger datasets), the following libraries will be useful:

- **Faiss**:
  - **Why**: Highly efficient library for similarity search, useful when retrieving top-k candidates after embedding.
  - **Key Functions**: `index` for building indices, `search` for retrieving top-k results.
  - **Installation**: `pip install faiss-cpu`
  - **Usage**:
    ```python
    import faiss
    import numpy as np

    # Example: Indexing and searching
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(768)  # for 768-dimensional embeddings
    embeddings = np.random.random((100, 768)).astype('float32')
    index.add(embeddings)
    D, I = index.search(embeddings[:5], k=10)  # top-10 results
    ```

### 4. **Evaluation**
For benchmarking your retrieval pipeline and computing evaluation metrics like **NDCG@10**, these libraries can be helpful:

- **scikit-learn**:
  - **Why**: Provides various metrics, including ranking metrics for evaluation.
  - **Key Functions**: `ndcg_score` for computing NDCG.
  - **Installation**: `pip install scikit-learn`
  - **Usage**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score

    # Example: Computing NDCG@10
    true_relevance = [[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]
    scores = [[0.8, 0.5, 0.4, 0.7, 0.3]]
    ndcg = ndcg_score(true_relevance, scores, k=10)
    ```

- **TREC_eval**:
  - **Why**: A tool commonly used in information retrieval for evaluating search and ranking models. It works well for tasks like NDCG computation on large-scale datasets.
  - **Installation**: Instructions available at [TREC_eval GitHub](https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval).

### 5. **Benchmarking and Experimentation**
For tracking and visualizing the performance of different model combinations during experiments:

- **Weights & Biases (W&B)**:
  - **Why**: Enables experiment tracking, logging of metrics, and visualization of performance trade-offs in a clear dashboard.
  - **Key Functions**: Logging metrics like NDCG@10, recording model performance, and visualizing results.
  - **Installation**: `pip install wandb`
  - **Usage**:
    ```python
    import wandb

    # Initialize project
    wandb.init(project="qa-retrieval-pipeline")

    # Log metrics
    wandb.log({"ndcg@10": ndcg_score})
    ```
