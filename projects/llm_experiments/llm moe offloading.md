You're looking to build a **Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLM architecture** with the ability to **offload data mid-inference to storage (disk) instead of RAM**. This is a high-level systems + ML engineering problem that sits at the intersection of:

- **Deep Learning (MoE, model parallelism, inference engines)**
    
- **Systems Programming (memory management, caching, I/O performance)**
    
- **Distributed Computing and Storage**
    

Here‚Äôs a structured roadmap of **what you should learn** to achieve this:

---

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites You Already Know

- ‚úÖ Python
    
- ‚úÖ PyTorch
    
- ‚úÖ Basics of LLMs

### üß† **Stage 1: Deepen Understanding of MoE and Inference Workflows**

1. **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**
    
    - Learn how gating and routing work in MoE.
        
    - Study existing architectures like:
        
        - [Switch Transformer (Google)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961)
            
        - [GShard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16668)
            
        - [DeepSpeed-MoE](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/mixture-of-experts/)
            
    - Focus on: _dynamic expert activation_, _sparse computation_, and _routing policy_.
        
2. **Model Parallelism and Offloading**
    
    - Learn about tensor, pipeline, and expert-level parallelism.
        
    - Study [FairScale](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale) and [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/)
        
    - Understand how ZeRO-Offload works (offloading optimizer states, gradients, etc. to CPU/disk).

### üñ•Ô∏è **Stage 2: Systems Programming for Inference Offloading**

To offload data mid-inference to disk **without crashing or slowing too much**, learn:

1. **Memory Management Basics**
    
    - How PyTorch stores tensors in RAM
        
    - `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`, `pin_memory`, and `non_blocking` transfers
        
2. **Custom Storage Systems / Disk Caching**
    
    - `mmap` (memory-mapped files)
        
    - Async disk I/O: `aiofiles`, `uvloop`, `libaio`
        
    - OS-level paging (e.g., Linux's virtual memory and swap)
        
3. **Storage-aware Computation**
    
    - Checkpointing vs recomputation
        
    - TorchScript and custom forward passes that can dump/load activations
        
    - Offloading with tools like `memray`, `zarr`, `h5py`, or `PyTorch-Lightning`'s offload plugins

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Stage 3: Build a Proof of Concept**

Start with:

- A toy MoE architecture with 10+ experts.
    
- Custom `forward()` that saves intermediate activations to disk (e.g., using `torch.save` to `/tmp/`).
    
- Load them back only when needed.
    

You can do this via:

```python
torch.save(hidden_state, '/tmp/expert5.pt')
# ... later
hidden_state = torch.load('/tmp/expert5.pt')
```

Then optimize with:

- Memory-mapped I/O (mmap)
    
- Asynchronous I/O
    
- On-the-fly compression (zlib, lz4, etc.)

### üß∞ Tools You‚Äôll Want to Explore

- **DeepSpeed MoE** (offloading + MoE training)
    
- **PyTorch + TorchScript** (custom ops)
    
- **FlashAttention / xformers** (for efficient attention when you go large-scale)
    
- **Apache Arrow / Zarr** for fast disk I/O
    
- **Ray / Dask** if you want to scale this to a cluster
