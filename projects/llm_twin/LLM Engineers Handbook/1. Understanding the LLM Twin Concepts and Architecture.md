	Designing the system architecture of the LLM Twin


### Understanding the LLM Twin concept

What is an LLM Twin?

an AI character thet incorporates yout writing style,voice, personality into an llm , which is a complex ai model

some scenarios of what you can fine-tune an LLM on to become your twin:

	LinkedIn posts and X threads: Specialize the LLM in writing social media content. 
	Messages with your friends and family: Adapt the LLM to an unfiltered version of yourself.
	Academic papers and articles: Calibrate the LLM in writing formal and educative content.
	Code: Specialize the LLM in implementing code as you would.

We want to build an LLM Twin to write personalized content on LinkedIn, X, Instagram, Substack, and Medium (or other blogs) using our style and voice. It will not be used in any immoral scenarios, but it will act as your writing co-pilot.

#### Why not use ChatGPT (or another similar chatbot)?

ChatGPT is not personalized to your writing style and voice. Instead, it is very generic, unarticulated, and wordy. Maintaining an original voice is critical for long-term success when building your brand.

will not yield the most optimal results. 
Even if you are OK with sharing impersonalized content, mindlessly using ChatGPT can result in the following: 
	- Misinformation due to hallucination: Manually checking the results for hallucinations or using third-party tools to evaluate your results is a tedious and unproductive experience. 	
	-
	- Tedious manual prompting: You must manually craft your prompts and inject external information, which is a tiresome experience. Also, the generated answers will be hard to replicate between multiple sessions as you don’t have complete control over your prompts and injected data. You can solve part of this problem using an API and a tool such as LangChain, but you need programming experience to do so.


The key of the LLM Twin stands in the following: 
	-What data we collect 
	-How we preprocess the data 
	-How we feed the data into the LLM 
	-How we chain multiple prompts for the desired results 
	-How we evaluate the generated content

The solution is to build an LLM system that encapsulates and automates all the following steps (manually replicating them each time is not a long-term and feasible solution):
	Data collection 
	Data preprocessing 
	Data storage, versioning, and retrieval 
	LLM fine-tuning 
	RAG 
	Content generation evaluation


The key to most successful ML products is to be data-centric and make your architecture model-agnostic.


### Planning the MVP of the LLM Twin product


we will go for the minimum viable product (MVP)

An MVP is a powerful strategy because of the following reasons: 
	Accelerated time-to-market: Launch a product quickly to gain early traction 
	Idea validation: Test it with real users before investing in the full development of the product Market research: Gain insights into what resonates with the target audience 
	Risk minimization: Reduces the time and resources needed for a product that might not achieve market success

features
	Collect data from your LinkedIn, Medium, Substack, and GitHub profiles 
	Fine-tune an open-source LLM using the collected data 
	Populate a vector database (DB) using our digital data for RAG 
	Create LinkedIn posts leveraging the following:
		 User prompts 
		 RAG to reuse and reference old content 
		 New posts, articles, or papers as additional knowledge to the LLM
	Have a simple web interface to interact with the LLM Twin and be able to do the following: Configure your social media links and trigger the collection step 
	Send prompts or links to external resources

#### Building ML systems with feature/training/inference pipelines

feature/training/inference (FTI) architecture.

However, training a model becomes complex when deciding on the correct architecture and hyperparameters. That’s not an engineering problem but a research problem.

We have to consider how to do the following: 
	Ingest, clean, and validate fresh data Training versus inference setups
	Compute and serve features in the right environment 
	Serve the model in a cost-effective way 
	Version, track, and share the datasets and models 
	Monitor your infrastructure and models 
	Deploy the model on a scalable infrastructure 
	Automate the deployments and training

### Designing the system architecture of the LLM Twin
In this section, we will list the concrete technical details of the LLM Twin application and understand how we can solve them by designing our LLM system using the FTI architecture. However, before diving into the pipelines, we want to highlight that we won’t focus on the tooling or the tech stack at this step. We only want to define a high-level architecture of the system, which is language-, framework-, platform-, and infrastructure-agnostic at this point. We will focus on each component’s scope, interface, and interconnectivity. In future chapters, we will cover the implementation details and tech stack. 

### Listing the technical details of the LLM Twin architecture

Until now, we defined what the LLM Twin should support from the user’s point of view. Now, let’s clarify the requirements of the ML system from a purely technical perspective:

On the data side, we have to do the following: 
	Collect data from LinkedIn, Medium, Substack, and GitHub completely autonomously and on a schedule 
	Standardize the crawled data and store it in a data warehouse 
	Clean the raw data 
	Create instruct datasets for fine-tuning an LLM
	Chunk and embed the cleaned data. 
	Store the vectorized data into a vector DB for RAG.
	
	 
For training, we have to do the following: 
	Fine-tune LLMs of various sizes (7B, 14B, 30B, or 70B parameters) 
	Fine-tune on instruction datasets of multiple sizes Switch between LLM types (for example, between Mistral, Llama, and GPT) 
	Track and compare experiments 
	Test potential production LLM candidates before deploying them 
	Automatically start the training when new instruction datasets are available. 

The inference code will have the following properties: 
	A REST API interface for clients to interact with the LLM Twin 
	Access to the vector DB in real time for RAG 
	Inference with LLMs of various sizes 
	Autoscaling based on user requests 
	Automatically deploy the LLMs that pass the evaluation step. 

The system will support the following LLMOps features: 
	Instruction dataset versioning, lineage, and reusability 
	Model versioning, lineage, and reusability 
	Experiment tracking 
	Continuous training, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CT/CI/CD) 
	Prompt and system monitoring

### Data collection pipeline

The data collection pipeline involves crawling your personal data from Medium, Substack, LinkedIn, and GitHub. As a data pipeline, we will use the extract, load, transform (ETL) pattern to extract data from social media platforms, standardize it, and load it into a data warehouse.

RAG points of view, it is vital to know what type of data we ingested, as each category must be
processed differently. For example, the chunking strategy between a post, article, and piece of
code will look different

by grouping the data by category, not the source, we can quickly plug data from other platforms,
such as X into the posts or GitLab into the code collection. As a modular system, we must
attach an additional ETL in the data collection pipeline, and everything else will work without
further code modifications.


### Feature pipeline

The characteristics of the FTI pattern are already present.
Here are some custom properties of the LLM Twin’s feature pipeline:
• It processes three types of data differently: articles, posts, and code
• It contains three main processing steps necessary for fine-tuning and RAG: cleaning,
chunking, and embedding
• It creates two snapshots of the digital data, one after cleaning (used for fine-tuning) and
one after embedding (used for RAG)
• It uses a logical feature store instead of a specialized feature store


The vector DB doesn’t offer the concept of a training dataset, but it can be used as a NoSQL DB.
This means we can access data points using their ID and collection name. Thus, we can easily
query the vector DB for new data points without any vector search logic.


Instead of integrating another DB, more concretely,
a specialized feature store, we used the vector DB, plus some additional logic to check all
the properties of a feature store our system needs.



- Processes raw articles, posts, and code data into a feature store for training and inference.
- Key steps:
    - **Cleaning**: Prepares data for fine-tuning.
    - **Chunking**: Splits data into manageable units.
    - **Embedding**: Converts data for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- Uses a **logical feature store** built on a vector database (vector DB), replacing a specialized feature store.
- Supports offline training (artifacts) and online inference (vector DB for context retrieval).
- The training pipeline will use the instruct datasets as artifacts, and the inference pipeline will query the vector DB for additional context using vector search techniques.

#### **Training Pipeline**

- Consumes datasets from the feature store to fine-tune LLMs and store weights in a model registry.
- when a new instruct dataset is available in the logical feature store, we will trigger the training pipeline, consume the artifact, and fine-tune the LLM.
- Involves:
    - Experimentation with hyperparameter tuning and tracking via experiment logs.
    - Continuous Training (CT) for automated retraining when new data is available.
    - Rigorous testing before production deployment, with manual approval for safety.

#### **Inference Pipeline**

- Serves user queries using a fine-tuned LLM and vector DB.
- Key features:
    - REST API for client queries.
    - Enriched prompts with RAG.
    - Monitoring for debugging and performance improvement.
- Designed for low-latency and scalable online operations.

#### **FTI Design Pattern (Feature, Training, Inference)**

- A modular approach that simplifies system design by focusing on interfaces and functionalities.
- Computing requirements:
    - Data collection and feature pipeline: CPU-based, horizontal scaling.
    - Training pipeline: GPU-based, vertical scaling.
    - Inference pipeline: Moderate compute, horizontal scaling for client requests.
- Supports dataset and model versioning, lineage, and reusability, adhering to CI/CD principles.

#### **Key Takeaways**

- The architecture efficiently handles data preparation, model training, and inference while ensuring modularity and scalability.
- Focused on practical application through MLOps best practices, including model registries, artifacts, and orchestration.
- Next chapters will dive into implementation and deployment details, emphasizing the integration of components into a cohesive system.
