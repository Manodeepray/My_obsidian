### Enhancing OpenAI’s GPT-OSS with Multimodal Vision Capabilities extensible to ISRO EO Data

**Background:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation. 
However, real-world applications often require reasoning across multiple modalities, particularly the ability to interpret and generate responses grounded in visual input. 
On 5th August 2025, OpenAI released GPT-OSS (20b and 120b) open-weight models with state-of-the-art real-world performance at low cost. 
GPT-OSS-120B achieves near-parity with OpenAI o4-mini on core reasoning benchmarks while running efficiently on single 80GB GPU. 
Detailed Description: While GPT-OSS performs very well in text-based reasoning, it cannot process or reason over images. 
The challenge is to augment GPT-OSS with visual perception — a lightweight projection-based alignment between a vision encoder and the LLM, trained using open datasets.
The proposed system is to demonstrate capable of image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and multimodal instruction-following, while preserving the open-source nature of the base model. 

Key challenges include: 
1.Aligning vision embeddings with the LLM’s text embedding space without degrading textual capabilities. 
2.Sourcing high-quality multimodal datasets that are open and permissive for redistribution. 3.Achieving competitive multimodal performance within reasonable compute budgets. Expected Solution: The proposed/developed solutions are to address the mentioned challenges by creating a reproducible multimodal GPT-OSS model trained with publicly available datasets and an efficient training strategy.

Following deliverables are expected:
1.A multimodal GPT-OSS model with vision understanding. 
2.Training scripts and dataset manifests for reproducibility. 
3.Benchmarks showing competitive performance against other open multimodal models. 
4.A foundation for extending GPT-OSS into more advanced multimodal reasoning domains. 5.Linkage to ISRO EO Data: Augmentation of vision capabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs can be adapted for EO data analysis and interpretation.
Such system could support highly accurate & automated Land-cover classification, change detection and environment monitoring by producing natural language explanations that cite visual evidence. 

Project aims to bridge the gap between Level-1 and Level-2 EO Data and decision makers/application users by enabling conversational exploration of large geospatial archives, interactive QA over time-series imagery and generation of rich, human readable reports that combine spatial analytics with domain specific reasoning.

### |Mitigating National Security Risks Posed by Large Language Models (LLMs) in AI-Driven Malign Information Operations|

**Background:**  
  
Large Language Models (LLMs) — such as OpenAI’s GPT series, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and Perplexity AI — have transformed digital ecosystems by enabling rapid generation of human-like, contextually coherent, and scalable textual content. These advancements power breakthroughs in research, automation, education, and communication. However, this technological democratization introduces critical national security vulnerabilities. Malicious actors — including state-sponsored cyber units, extremist organizations, and sophisticated criminal networks — are now exploiting LLMs to:  
• Generate highly personalized phishing emails with improved linguistic fluency and contextual relevance.  
• Automate large-scale disinformation campaigns to manipulate public sentiment and undermine democratic institutions.  
• Fabricate synthetic extremist propaganda to radicalize individuals and recruit operatives.  
• Engage in influence operations at a scale and speed that traditional human-led misinformation campaigns could not achieve.  
  
The ability to create plausible, non-repetitive, and linguistically diverse narratives significantly complicates detection, attribution, and takedown efforts by national security and cyber defense teams.  
  
**Detailed Description:**  
  
This problem requires the design and implementation of a multi-layered technical and policy framework to detect, analyze, and mitigate the misuse of LLMs in hostile information operations. The framework must incorporate cutting-edge AI, machine learning, and cyber defense methodologies.  
  
**Key technical requirements include:**  
  
**1. Real-Time AI-Generated Content Detection**  
• Deploy advanced transformer-based classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, T5, or GPT detectors) trained on large-scale, labeled datasets of AI-generated vs. human-generated content.  
• Utilize stylometric and semantic feature extraction to identify LLM-specific language patterns, entropy levels, and token probability distributions.  
• Implement multi-modal detection by analyzing text, metadata, and social graph propagation patterns simultaneously.  
  
**2. Attribution and Forensics**  
• Build forensic watermarking and fingerprinting techniques to tag, trace, and verify LLM outputs, leveraging solutions like OpenAI watermarking APIs or cryptographic hashes.  
• Use reverse engineering and stylometric analysis to attribute content to specific model families or platforms.  
  
**3. Graph-Based Threat Intelligence and Monitoring**  
• Integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) to map disinformation clusters, actor coordination patterns, and propagation chains across platforms.  
• Develop APIs for integration with threat intelligence platforms and security information and event management (SIEM) tools for real-time correlation.  
  
**4. Cross-Border Intelligence Sharing**  
• Create a federated detection and intelligence-sharing protocol that enables secure data exchange between allied nations without violating data localization and privacy laws.  
• Utilize standardized APIs and blockchain-based audit trails for tamper-proof information sharing.  
  
**5. Automated Risk and Threat Assessment**  
• Build dashboard-driven analytics with real-time risk scoring and visualization layers for national security agencies.  
• Include heatmaps, temporal trend analysis, and predictive modelling for proactive threat anticipation.  
  
**6. Vendor Collaboration and Red-Teaming**  
• Partner with LLM providers to enforce Responsible AI guidelines, such as abuse-limiting guardrails and adversarial testing protocols.  
• Conduct continuous red-team simulations to expose vulnerabilities and strengthen platform defences.  
  
**7. Privacy and Compliance Integration**  
• Embed privacy-preserving techniques, including federated learning and differential privacy, to ensure data security and adherence to legal frameworks.  
• Incorporate transparency reporting and explainable AI (XAI) layers to maintain accountability and public trust.  
  
**Expected Solution:**  
  
The envisioned solution is a hybrid platform combining AI-driven analytics, forensic capabilities, and policy integration to support real-time detection, attribution, and response to LLM-driven malign information operations.  
  
**Key deliverables include:**  
• A deployable software platform with APIs for integration into national security operations centres (SOCs) and cyber defence networks.  
• High-accuracy detection engines with precision and recall exceeding 90% in detecting AI-generated malicious narratives across text and multimedia formats.  
• Federated intelligence-sharing systems enabling rapid, coordinated response at a national and international level.  
• Comprehensive policy framework outlining governance models, vendor obligations, and oversight mechanisms to balance security with civil liberties.

| Description  | **Background**  <br>  <br>Oceanographic data is vast, complex, and heterogeneous – ranging from satellite observations to in-situ measurements like CTD casts, Argo floats, and BGC sensors. The Argo program, which deploys autonomous profiling floats across the world’s oceans, generates an extensive dataset in NetCDF format containing temperature, salinity, and other essential ocean variables. Accessing, querying, and visualizing this data requires domain knowledge, technical skills, and familiarity with complex formats and tools. With the rise of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), especially when combined with modern structured databases and interactive dashboards, it is now feasible to create intuitive, accessible systems that democratize access to ocean data.  <br>  <br>**Description**  <br>  <br>The current problem statement proposes the development of an AI-powered conversational system for ARGO float data that enables users to query, explore, and visualize oceanographic information using natural language.  <br>  <br>The current system shall:  <br>− Ingest ARGO NetCDF files and convert them into structured formats (like SQL/Parquet).  <br>− Use a vector database (like FAISS/Chroma) to store metadata and summaries for retrieval.  <br>− Leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines powered by multimodal LLMs (such as GPT, QWEN, LLaMA, or Mistral) to interpret user queries and map them to database queries (SQL). (Use Model Context Protocol (MCP))  <br>− Enable interactive dashboards (via Streamlit or Dash) for visualization of ARGO profiles, such as mapped trajectories, depth-time plots, and profile comparisons, etc.  <br>− Provide a chatbot-style interface where users can ask questions like:  <br>  • Show me salinity profiles near the equator in March 2023  <br>  • Compare BGC parameters in the Arabian Sea for the last 6 months  <br>  • What are the nearest ARGO floats to this location?  <br>  <br>This tool will bridge the gap between domain experts, decision-makers, and raw data by allowing non-technical users to extract meaningful insights effortlessly.  <br>  <br>**Expected Solution**  <br>  <br>− End-to-end pipeline to process ARGO NetCDF data and store it in a relational (PostgreSQL) and vector database (FAISS/Chroma).  <br>− Backend LLM system that translates natural language into database queries and generates responses using RAG.  <br>− Frontend dashboard with geospatial visualizations (using Plotly, Leaflet, or Cesium) and tabular summaries to ASCII, NetCDF.  <br>− Chat interface that understands user intent and guides them through data discovery.  <br>− Demonstrate a working Proof-of-Concept (PoC) with Indian Ocean ARGO data and future extensibility to in-situ observations (BGC, glider, buoys, etc.), and satellite datasets.  <br>  <br>**Acronyms**  <br>  <br>NetCDF: Network Common Data Format  <br>CTD: Conductivity Temperature and Depth  <br>BGC: Bio-Geo-Chemical Floats |

#### 1. Augment RAG with a Knowledge Graph (GraphRAG)

Your current plan uses a vector database for retrieval, which is great for semantic similarity. The innovation here is to model the relationships between data points explicitly.

- **Research Concept:** Oceanographic data is not just a collection of points; it's a network of interconnected measurements. An ARGO float's data is related to its previous measurements (a trajectory), to nearby floats, and to known oceanographic features (like eddies or currents). A **Knowledge Graph (KG)** can capture these complex relationships far better than a standard vector database.
    
- **Implementation:**
    
    - Create a KG where nodes are ARGO floats, specific profiles (a single dive), and named oceanographic features (e.g., "Agulhas Current," "El Niño Event 2023").
        
    - Edges would represent relationships like `has_trajectory`, `is_near`, `passed_through`, and `measured_during`.
        
    - Your RAG pipeline becomes **GraphRAG**. When a user asks, "Show me floats that were affected by the recent cyclone in the Arabian Sea," the system first queries the KG to identify the relevant floats and time periods, then retrieves the detailed time-series data from the SQL database.
        
    - This enables much more complex, context-aware reasoning than simple semantic search.

#### 2. Predictive and Anomaly-Detecting Agents

Instead of just retrieving historical data, your system can actively forecast and identify scientifically interesting events.

- **Research Concept:** Develop specialized AI agents that use the queried data to perform real-time analysis. This moves the system from a passive data browser to a proactive scientific assistant.
    
- **Implementation:**
    
    - **Forecasting Agent:** When a user queries a float's trajectory, this agent could use the historical temperature/salinity data to run a small time-series forecasting model (like Prophet or a lightweight LSTM) to predict the values for the next 24-48 hours. The LLM would present this as: "Here is the data for float #WMO_ID. Based on its recent trend, the sea surface temperature is forecasted to be X in 24 hours. Would you like to see the confidence interval?"
        
    - **Anomaly Detection Agent:** This agent would constantly compare a float's readings (e.g., salinity) against its own historical data and against nearby floats. If it detects a statistically significant deviation, it can flag it. The LLM could then proactively inform the user: "While querying data in the Bay of Bengal, an anomalous low-salinity layer was detected by float #WMO_ID. This could indicate freshwater influx. Would you like to investigate?"

#### 3. Self-Correcting, Multi-Step Reasoning for Query Planning

You mentioned training an SLM with RL (like GRPO) for planning. This is a fantastic research direction. Let's formalize it.

- **Research Concept:** Complex queries like "Compare BGC parameters in the Arabian Sea before and during this year's monsoon" are not single SQL queries. They require a multi-step plan. The innovation is creating a **self-correcting pipeline** where the LLM reasons, acts, observes the result, and refines its plan.
    
- **Implementation:**
    
    - **Planner-Executor-Critic Model:**
        
        1. **Planner (LLM):** Receives the user's prompt and breaks it down into a sequence of steps. E.g., `[1. Identify monsoon onset date for the Arabian Sea from a knowledge base. 2. Query BGC data before this date. 3. Query BGC data after this date. 4. Generate a comparative plot.]`
            
        2. **Executor (Agent):** Takes step 1, converts it to a SQL query (or other tool call), and executes it.
            
        3. **Critic (LLM/Rule-based):** Examines the result. Did the query fail? Return an empty set? If so, the Critic provides feedback to the Planner. ("Error: The date format was incorrect" or "Result was empty, perhaps widen the search radius?").
            
        4. The Planner revises the plan and the Executor tries again. This loop makes the system incredibly robust and capable of handling ambiguity. This is a direct implementation of reinforcement learning principles.

#### 4. True Multimodal Integration for Data Discovery

You asked about multimodal reasoning. This is a prime area for innovation that ties directly into how oceanographers work.

- **Research Concept:** Fuse text-based querying with visual data analysis. An oceanographer might see an interesting feature on a satellite map and want to immediately query in-situ data for that exact spot.
    
- **Implementation:**
    
    - Integrate a multimodal LLM (like LLaVA or GPT-4o).
        
    - In your UI (the "Poseidon" dashboard), allow the user to upload a satellite image (e.g., a sea surface temperature map).
        
    - The user can then highlight a region on the map and ask a natural language question like: "**What ARGO floats have reported in this anomalous warm patch over the last month?**"
        
    - The multimodal LLM will interpret both the image (to get the geographic coordinates of the patch) and the text to generate the precise query for your backend. This bridges the gap between large-scale remote sensing and point-based in-situ measurements, a significant challenge in the field.

### **Foundational AI and Efficient Architectures for Edge and Embedded Systems**


https://gemini.google.com/app/b3a88ead75cee203 

compression techniques

This phrase is about creating **new AI methods** and **hardware/software designs** that can run AI models on **edge devices** (like smartphones, IoT sensors, drones, medical devices, or smart cameras) rather than only on big cloud servers.

---

#### **Key Points**

1. **Foundational AI Innovations**
    
    - Research and develop **core AI techniques** (not just applications, but the underlying methods).
        
    - Focus on approaches that can adapt to small, low-power devices.
        
    - Examples:
        
        - Lightweight neural network architectures (e.g., MobileNet, TinyML models).
            
        - New training methods that make models more efficient.
            
2. **Low-power, High-performance, Resource-optimized Architectures**
    
    - **Low-power:** Essential for devices running on batteries (wearables, drones).
        
    - **High-performance:** Even though the hardware is small, AI tasks like vision, speech recognition, or anomaly detection must run quickly.
        
    - **Resource-optimized:** Edge devices have limited CPU, memory, and storage. The AI must be designed to use these efficiently.
        
3. **Suitable for Edge and Embedded Devices**
    
    - Unlike cloud data centers, edge devices **cannot rely on huge GPUs or TPUs**.
        
    - They need **custom-tailored AI solutions** that run locally and independently.
        
    - Benefits:
        
        - Lower latency (real-time decisions).
            
        - Higher privacy (data doesn’t need to go to the cloud).
            
        - Reduced bandwidth usage.
            
4. **Techniques like Quantization**
    
    - **Quantization** = reducing the precision of model parameters (e.g., from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit integers).
        
    - This reduces memory use and speeds up inference, often with only minor accuracy loss.
        
    - Other efficiency techniques:
        
        - **Pruning** (remove unnecessary weights/connections).
            
        - **Knowledge distillation** (train a smaller "student" model using a large "teacher" model).
            
        - **Hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS)**
