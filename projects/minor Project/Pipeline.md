Here's a more **detailed expansion** of your project structure, covering each section in depth:

---

## **üìú Structured Document (PPT + Report) Outline**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction**

- This project aims to **automate attendance tracking and attentiveness analysis** in classrooms using **computer vision and AI**.
- The system **records a classroom video**, detects and recognizes students' faces, and determines their **presence and engagement levels**.
- A separate module records **lecture audio**, transcribes it, and processes it using an **LLM** to generate **structured class notes**.
- The **final output** is a **dashboard** where teachers and students can view attendance, attentiveness stats, and class notes.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Motivation**

- **Manual attendance tracking** is inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to errors.
- **Attentiveness analysis** is a crucial metric for understanding student engagement but is difficult to measure manually.
- **AI-based automation** makes attendance tracking **accurate, non-intrusive, and scalable**.
- Students often struggle with **taking notes** during class‚Äîan **LLM-generated transcript** can help **improve learning outcomes**.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Background Studies**

- **Face Recognition Techniques:**
    - Explored **DeepFace, dlib, YOLO, and facial points-based models** for **student identification**.
    - Compared accuracy, speed, and robustness for **real-world classroom settings**.
- **Classroom Behavior Analysis:**
    - Research on **student engagement tracking** via gaze estimation, posture detection, and face visibility.
- **Speech-to-Text and LLM-Based Summarization:**
    - Used **whisper, Vosk, or DeepSpeech** for audio transcription.
    - Processed **text output** with an **LLM** to generate **well-structured, readable notes**.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Objective**

- **Automate attendance marking** using **face recognition**.
- **Measure attentiveness** based on the **duration a student‚Äôs face is visible**.
- **Transcribe class lectures** and process them with an **LLM** to generate structured **class notes**.
- **Store and visualize** attendance & attentiveness metrics on a **dashboard**.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Social Impact**

- **Improves student engagement** by **identifying distracted students**.
- **Ensures accurate attendance tracking** without manual effort.
- **Creates accessible study material** for students, **especially helpful for those who miss classes**.
- **Supports teachers in performance analysis**‚Äîhelps understand class participation.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Methodology (Tools & Technologies)**

#### **‚û§ Hardware & Setup**

- **Camera Placement:**
    - Positioned **above the blackboard** for optimal **face visibility tracking**.
- **Microphone:**
    - High-quality **.wav audio recording** for **clear transcription**.

#### **‚û§ Face Detection & Recognition**

- **Face detection using YuNet (OpenCV):**
    - Extracts faces from **each frame** of the recorded classroom video.
- **Face recognition using YOLOv11 (Switching to a facial points-based model):**
    - **Matches faces** with student database to **mark attendance**.
    - **Attendance is marked** if a student appears in **>30% of frames**.

#### **‚û§ Attentiveness Analysis**

- **Faces are tracked across frames** to measure **visibility duration**.
- **Higher face visibility ‚Üí Higher attentiveness score**.
- Data is stored in **CSV format** and uploaded to a **cloud database**.

#### **‚û§ Data Processing & Storage**

- Extracted **attendance & attentiveness data is stored in CSV format**.
- Data is uploaded to a **cloud database** for **real-time monitoring**.
- Teachers and students can access the **dashboard for insights**.

#### **‚û§ LLM-Based Note Generation**

- **Class audio is recorded as a .wav file**.
- **Speech-to-text conversion** using **Whisper or Vosk**.
- Processed with **LLM** to generate **concise, well-structured notes**.

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Experimental Observations**

- **Tried different face recognition methods:**
    - **DeepFace, dlib, YOLO ‚Üí Moving to a facial points-based model**.
- **Tested multiple attentiveness measurement techniques**:
    - **Face visibility duration**, **gaze tracking**, **head orientation**.
- **Visualized results using Streamlit:**
    - Displayed **attendance data**.
    - Showed **attentiveness analytics** with graphs & reports.

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion**

- Successfully **developed a working prototype** of the system.
- Automated **attendance marking and attentiveness analysis**.
- Integrated **LLM for class note generation**.
- Plans for **improvements:**
    - **Real-time face tracking**.
    - **Better recognition accuracy**.
    - **Enhanced class note structuring with advanced LLMs**.

---

### **üìå Next Steps**

1. **Finalize documentation** (detailed report & PPT).
2. **Optimize the face recognition model** for better accuracy.
3. **Improve the Streamlit UI** for a **better user experience**.
4. **Optimize LLM-generated notes** to improve readability.
