This is a _fantastic_ Research Assistant opportunity, and you’re already close given your prior work in deep learning, vision, transformers, and MLOps. To touch up and prepare effectively for interviews, here's a **targeted action plan** broken down into five parts:

# interview summary
### ✅ **1. Brush Up Technical Foundations (Must-Have Skills)**

#### 🔹 **Python & PyTorch**

- Review Python internals (list comprehensions, generators, decorators, OOP).
    
- Revise PyTorch:
    
    - Custom datasets & dataloaders
        
    - Transformer-based models (`nn.Transformer`, HuggingFace, etc.)
        
    - Autograd, training loops, optimizer/scheduler setup
        
    - GPU usage (`.cuda()`, `with torch.no_grad()`, etc.)
        

> Practice: Rebuild a simple Transformer from scratch in PyTorch for sequence prediction.

#### 🔹 **Deep Learning & ML Theory**

- Focus on:
    
    - Bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization
        
    - Attention mechanism, positional encodings, encoder-decoder setups
        
    - Time-series modeling: RNNs, TCNs, Transformers for time series (e.g. Informer, Autoformer)
        

> Use cheat sheets + dive into “Time Series with Deep Learning” by Francesco Gadaleta or similar.

---

### ✅ **2. Prepare Time-Series Deep Learning Showcase**

Since it's a **core focus**, you should build or polish a **small project or Colab demo** that includes:

| Component | Example                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dataset   | M4, UCI Electricity Load, Yahoo anomaly detection            |
| Baselines | ARIMA, Prophet, Exponential Smoothing                        |
| DL Models | LSTM, Transformer, N-BEATS, Autoformer                       |
| Tools     | PyTorch Lightning, Optuna for tuning, MLflow/W&B for logging |

> Ideally, this should be a public GitHub repo or blog post you can _share in the interview_.

---

### ✅ **3. Research Reproduction + Reading**

Pick **1–2 papers** relevant to time-series transformers and implement/extend them:

#### 🔸 Recommended:

- [Informer: Efficient Transformer for Long Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07436)
    
- [Autoformer: Decomposition Transformers with Auto-Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13008)
    
- [PatchTST: Effective Time Series Forecasting with NIPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730)
    

> Implement one and write a short report (Jupyter Notebook + README). Talk about what worked, what didn't.

---

### ✅ **4. MLOps & Cloud Readiness**

#### 🔹 Basics:

- Dockerize your time-series pipeline.
    
- Use DVC or MLflow to version models and data.
    
- Run training on a GPU VM (preferably GCP or AWS with a spot instance).
    

#### 🔹 AWS Basics (Nice-to-Have):

- **S3** for dataset storage
    
- **SageMaker Studio Lab or local setup** to simulate training
    
- Learn how to launch and SSH into EC2 and install CUDA toolkit
    

---

### ✅ **5. Interview Prep & Behavioral Touch-Ups**

#### 📄 Prepare Answers For:

- _“Tell me about a research project where you extended a paper.”_
    
- _“How do you deal with data leakage or lookahead bias in time series?”_
    
- _“How would you compare performance between a statistical baseline and a DL model?”_
    
- _“Tell us about a time you worked with a team on code/research.”_
    

> Bonus: Prepare to discuss your **GitHub** projects and **model evaluations (RMSE, MAE, MASE, etc.)** clearly.

---

### 🚀 **Optional Add-Ons to Shine**

- Add a “Research Highlights” section to your resume or GitHub README.
    
- Contribute a minor PR to an open-source time-series repo (e.g., [Darts](https://github.com/unit8co/darts), [GluonTS](https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts))
    
- Set up a mini Streamlit app to visualize your forecasting model.
