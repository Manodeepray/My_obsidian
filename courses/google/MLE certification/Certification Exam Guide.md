## 1.1 Developing ML models by using BigQuery ML. Considerations include:

 - Building the appropriate BigQuery ML model (e.g., linear and binary classification, regression, time-series, matrix factorization, boosted trees, autoencoders) based on the business problem
 - Feature engineering or selection by using BigQuery ML.
 -  Generating predictions by using BigQuery ML
