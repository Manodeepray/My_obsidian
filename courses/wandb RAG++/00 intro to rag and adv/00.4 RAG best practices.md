Building a great RAG system like Wandbot involves following some important best practices. Here are some key lessons we learned:

**1. Start with a clear purpose:**

Define exactly what you want your RAG system to do.  
Set specific goals and metrics to measure its success. For Wandbot, we wanted to improve how users navigate our documentation, so we tracked metrics like user satisfaction and search success rate.

**2. Ensure high-quality data:**

Your RAG system is only as good as the information it can access.  
Make sure your knowledge base is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

**3. Embrace evaluation and iteration:**

Continuously test and evaluate your system's performance.~  
Use the results to identify areas for improvement and make changes accordingly.

**4. Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework:**

Don't just focus on accuracy.`  
Consider other factors like relevance, faithfulness to the source material, and user satisfaction.

**5. Involve subject matter experts:**

Even though LLMs are powerful, they can still make mistakes.  
Have experts review the system's responses regularly to ensure they are accurate and make sense.

**6. Prioritize user experience:**

Design a user interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate.  
Make it easy for users to find the information they need.

**7. Be transparent:**

Let users know they are interacting with a bot.  
Provide citations for the information your system provides so users can verify it if they want.

**8. Commit to continuous improvement:**

User needs and information change over time.  
Keep your knowledge base up-to-date and make ongoing improvements to your RAG system.
