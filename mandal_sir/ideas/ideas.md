murari : I need to know about some ideas where we pit 2 or more LLMs against each other or make them work in collaboration to do something.. what are some of the tasks that would benefit from such multi Agent LLM interactions? Don't answer randomly, give me some references/real world use cases...

Think of Game Theory Principles, Cooperative Game Theory, Nash Equilibrium.. etc...

Also, we should think theideas at Inference level, should not change the original model but play around with the CoTs, RAGs, etc.


neel : one of the first things that strike me is reasoning. I haven't seen any papers on this, but if 2 LLMs, both acting as each other's critic engage in a loop till a certain theta threshold (theta being some amount of equality in both LLM answers).

a lot like how human critical conversations work.

this needs to be empirically tested and if prepared with the right frameworks, could open up a branch for multi LLM discussion and reasoning improvement.



people want experts in a certain field instead of jack of all trades














Certainly! Here’s a list of some additional theories in game theory and decision science that shape how we understand strategic choices in competitive and cooperative situations:

### 1. **Zero-Sum Games**
   - In zero-sum games, one player’s gain is exactly another player’s loss. Chess and poker are examples because one player's win means another's loss. This contrasts with cooperative games, where all players can benefit.

### 2. **Bayesian Games**
   - These involve scenarios where players have incomplete information about others. Instead of knowing everything, players rely on probability (beliefs) about unknown factors, like in auctions where bidders don’t know each other’s valuations of an item.

### 3. **Evolutionary Game Theory**
   - Instead of rational decision-makers, this theory models behavior across populations over time, often focusing on strategies that succeed and “survive” in nature. It’s used in biology to study animal behavior and in economics to understand trends in human behavior.

### 4. **Prisoner's Dilemma**
   - A famous example where two people must decide whether to cooperate or betray each other without knowing the other’s choice. Both would benefit from cooperating, but the risk of betrayal often leads each to act in self-interest, resulting in worse outcomes for both.

### 5. **Stag Hunt**
   - This describes situations where cooperation is beneficial, but risky. Players must choose between a high-reward, risky option (hunting a stag) and a low-reward, safer option (hunting a hare). This is often applied to scenarios requiring trust, like business alliances.

### 6. **Shapley Value**
   - This concept from cooperative game theory calculates how to fairly distribute the total “value” (like profits or benefits) among players based on their individual contributions. It’s commonly used in economics and resource management.

### 7. **Mechanism Design Theory**
   - Also called “reverse game theory,” this focuses on designing rules or incentives to ensure desired outcomes. It’s used in creating auctions, government policies, and even social media algorithms, where incentives shape behavior.

### 8. **Cournot Competition**
   - This models situations where companies compete by setting production quantities rather than prices. Each company decides how much to produce, affecting total market supply and price. It’s common in industries with limited players, like oil or telecom.

### 9. **Stackelberg Competition**
   - In this game model, one firm acts as a leader, setting quantities or prices first, while others follow, reacting to the leader’s move. It’s used to study markets with dominant players, like a big retailer influencing smaller stores.

### 10. **Repeated Games**
   - Here, players play the same game multiple times, learning from past rounds. This setup encourages cooperation since players face each other repeatedly, and trust (or betrayal) builds up, influencing future choices.

### 11. **Coalitional Game Theory**
   - Similar to cooperative game theory but focuses on the formation and stability of coalitions, or groups. It analyzes what makes people form alliances and what will keep them together, such as countries forming trade agreements.

### 12. **Minimax Theorem**
   - In zero-sum games, this principle helps players minimize their maximum possible loss. It’s used in situations like chess, where each player assumes the opponent will play optimally, leading to strategies that protect against the worst-case outcome.

Each theory provides insight into different types of strategic interactions, from personal decisions to large-scale economic systems, and they’re applied across business, biology, politics, and psychology to understand choices and their ripple effects.







### 1. **SQ3R Method (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review)**

- This five-step approach involves surveying a text (scanning headings and summaries), asking questions about the content, reading to find answers, reciting or summarizing key points, and reviewing everything to reinforce learning.

Agent LLMs are autonomous language models designed to perform specific tasks by following a series of pre-defined steps or "policies." These "agents" are capable of:

1. **Interpreting Commands**: They take natural language instructions to understand what task to perform.
2. **Planning Actions**: Use logic or decision-making frameworks to sequence actions.
3. **Executing Actions**: They call APIs, use tools, or interact with environments to complete tasks (like data retrieval, calculations, or other functions).
4. **Providing Feedback**: They can track and update their progress, adjusting strategies if needed.

Agent LLMs often rely on frameworks like LangChain or OpenAI's function-calling API to access external tools and integrate seamlessly into applications.


## INVERSE RAG 

first how does RAG work?

1. Retrieval : using similarity search -> context from database
2. Argument : context + query as argument into LLM with some prompt 
3. Generate : LLM generates the response
### my idea

1. an agent (LLM) takes query for editing a topic or unlearning it from a LLM
2. LLM generates what to unlearn or edit -> give everything about the topic/ person -> method to extract everything related to it
3. Agent then  edits data as per the request
4. the data is then converted to appropriate format for unlearning method or editing method by the agent
5. then as per the query the agent applies the method on LLM with the forgetting / editing dataset


what to gather from the query
-->topic
-->request type
-->data to be edited/unlearned

### My Idea: Agent-Based Framework for Topic Editing or Unlearning in LLMs

1. **Agent-Driven Query Processing**
   - An intelligent agent (powered by a Large Language Model, or LLM) receives a query specifying the need to either *edit* or *unlearn* knowledge related to a particular topic, entity, or individual in an LLM. 
   - The agent interprets the request type (e.g., remove, modify, or restrict information) and identifies key topic on which these changes are required.

2. **Comprehensive Knowledge Extraction**
   - The LLM (acting as the core knowledge source) generates all information associated with the target topic or entity. This could include descriptions, historical facts, attributes, or any specific associations.
   - The agent then employs a method to systematically extract everything relevant to the topic, ensuring all potential connections and references are captured for a thorough unlearning or editing process.

3. **Customized Data Editing**
   - The agent reviews the extracted data and applies necessary modifications based on the query. 
   - If the task is to unlearn (forget) information, the agent flags or removes sensitive details. If the task is to edit, the agent modifies relevant data to reflect new, corrected, or redacted information.

4. **Preparation of Unlearning/Editing Dataset**
   - The edited or flagged data is then formatted appropriately by the agent, aligning it with the required structure for unlearning or editing processes.
   - This step ensures that the data can seamlessly integrate with the LLM’s unlearning or knowledge editing mechanism, which may involve specific formatting or metadata tagging for easy access and processing.

5. **Application of Unlearning or Editing**
   - Based on the query’s requirements, the agent initiates the selected method (unlearning or editing) on the LLM.
   - Using the prepared dataset, the agent applies either an unlearning approach (to “forget” the information) or an editing approach (to update or modify the information) within the LLM. 
   - This step finalizes the request, making the necessary changes to the LLM’s outputs without affecting unrelated knowledge.

Q. how can this be done to the llm itself and evaluate it too


This approach provides a structured, agent-driven workflow for precise knowledge management in LLMs, making it adaptable for both open-source and closed-source environments. The method ensures minimal model disruption while offering customizable and controlled knowledge updates.


# IDEA 2

method of knowledge editing using long continuous prompting and combining it with a methodology  like that of astute rag to minimize hallucination and conflict between the system and llm... maybe somehow integrating multimodal editing on contextual knowledge...



prompts for editing
repo                              prompt / edited data
continuous prompt


user query

network similar to knowledge sentinel to find similar prompts from repo
system similar to astute rag paper and machine unlearning paper with rag  that would compare the retrieved prompts/data (or unlearned/edited database ) and internal knowledge     
then it either allows or does not allow the info to the user 

here we can add more methods at the end to get a better output
