method of knowledge editing using long continuous prompting and combining it with a methodology  like that of astute rag to minimize hallucination and conflict between the system and llm... maybe somehow integrating multimodal editing on contextualÂ knowledge...



prompts for editing
repo                              prompt / edited data
continuous prompt


user query

network similar to knowledge sentinel to find similar prompts from repo
system similar to astute rag paper and machine unlearning paper with rag  that would compare the retrieved prompts/data (or unlearned/edited database ) and internal knowledge     
then it either allows or does not allow the info to the user 

here we can add more methods at the end to get a better output
