we identify key factor affecting unlearning difficulty and the performance of unlearning algorithms.

general unlearning framework, dubbed RSU, which consists of Ranking module and SeqUnlearn module. RSU is compatible with most of the existing unlearning methods and substantially improves topperforming unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted to comprehensively demonstrate RSUâ€™s effectiveness in unlearning performance.
