murari : I need to know about some ideas where we pit 2 or more LLMs against each other or make them work in collaboration to do something.. what are some of the tasks that would benefit from such multi Agent LLM interactions? Don't answer randomly, give me some references/real world use cases...

Think of Game Theory Principles, Cooperative Game Theory, Nash Equilibrium.. etc...

Also, we should think theideas at Inference level, should not change the original model but play around with the CoTs, RAGs, etc.


neel : one of the first things that strike me is reasoning. I haven't seen any papers on this, but if 2 LLMs, both acting as each other's critic engage in a loop till a certain theta threshold (theta being some amount of equality in both LLM answers).

a lot like how human critical conversations work.

this needs to be empirically tested and if prepared with the right frameworks, could open up a branch for multi LLM discussion and reasoning improvement.
