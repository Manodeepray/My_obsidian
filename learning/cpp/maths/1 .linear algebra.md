vectors are special objects that can be added together  and multiplied by scalars to produce another object of same kind 

- geometric vectors
	- directed segments , which can be drawn (atleast in 2 dim)
	- x^- and y^- can be dded such that
	- $$x^- + y^- = z^-$$
	- z^- is another geometric vector
	- when multiplied by scalars $$\lambda$$ the result will also be a geometric vector
	- $$ \lambda * x^- , where \lambda  \in \mathrm{R}  $$
	- where $$\lambda * x^- $$is also a geometric vector , i.e original vector scaled by lambda
