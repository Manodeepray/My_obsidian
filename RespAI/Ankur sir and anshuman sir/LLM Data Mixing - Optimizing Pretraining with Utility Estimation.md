Briefing Document: Optimizing Pretraining Data Mixtures with LLM-Estimated Utility

1. Executive Summary:

This paper addresses the critical challenge of optimizing data mixtures for Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining. It highlights the increasing complexity of LLM training data, which now comprises diverse sub-corpora from various sources. The core problem is how to sample effectively from these sources to achieve the best possible model performance, balancing data quality, quantity, and diversity. The authors introduce two novel approaches: UtiliMax and Model Estimated Data Utility (MEDU), which aim to automate and improve the efficiency of data mixing. Key findings indicate that simple token-count heuristics are surprisingly effective baselines, and that UtiliMax and MEDU can significantly enhance performance, particularly in compute-efficient data mixing.

2. Problem Statement:

• Data Mixing Complexity: Modern LLM pretraining involves numerous datasets from different domains, making manual data mixing challenging. The datasets aren't necessarily aligned with a specific "intended use," as LLMs are developed for general-purpose functionality.

◦ "Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining data increasingly consists of sub-corpora from many sources covering multiple domains and varying in size...Unlike traditional multi-task learning scenarios, datasets are not necessarily aligned with a specific intended use."

• Need for Optimization: Given a fixed computational budget, the crucial question is how to sample from each corpus to maximize model performance across multiple downstream tasks.

◦"Given multiple training corpora and multiple downstream goals, how should we sample from each corpus to get the best possible model?"

•Challenges with Existing Methods: Prior approaches, both heuristic and learned, lack comprehensive comparison and evaluation across different compute scales and token budgets. Furthermore, the robustness of these methods to the effects of epoching (repeatedly using the same data) is unclear, especially as frontier models become increasingly data-constrained.

◦"However, there is minimal comparison between these methods using the same data and model configuration. Furthermore, it is unclear whether these approaches are robust to the impacts of epoching which is critical as frontier models are increasingly data-constrained."

•Resource Allocation Problem: Data mixing can be framed as a resource allocation problem, but directly optimizing utility is intractable due to the high cost of full-scale training runs.

◦"With budget in mind, data mixing is a resource allocation problem...optimizing utility µ directly is intractable given the cost of full-scale training runs."

1. Key Contributions & Methods:

•

Comprehensive Baseline Evaluation: The paper re-implements and compares nine baseline data mixing methods (including Uniform, Proportional, OLMo, DoReMi, ODM variations, etc.) in a unified setup, evaluating them across different compute scales and data scenarios (compute-constrained vs. data-constrained).

◦

"We re-implement and compare nine baselines in a unified setup across likely training scenarios."

•

UtiliMax: This novel method combines utility estimates from reduced-scale ablations on individual datasets with dataset size to optimize data mixes using portfolio optimization (based on the Markowitz model). It maximizes risk-adjusted utility, balancing expected reward with risk.

◦

"We propose UtiliMax, which combines utility estimates and dataset size to find data mixes using portfolio optimization. We show UtiliMax improves results by using reduced-scale ablations on individual datasets to estimate data utility."

•

Model Estimated Data Utility (MEDU): This approach leverages existing LLMs to estimate data utility from small samples of training data. It prompts LLMs to describe useful training data based on benchmark development sets, then uses these descriptions to classify utility for training documents.

◦

"We prompt LLMs to describe useful training data based on benchmark development sets, then use these descriptions to classify utility for a sample of the training data. These estimates are effective utility estimates for UtiliMax, but are 200x less costly to compute."

•

Dolma V1.7 Dataset: Experiments use the Dolma V1.7 dataset, a large, open corpus of 2.1 trillion tokens.

◦

"We use Dolma V1.7 (Soldaini et al., 2024), which is released under the Open Data Commons License, for our experiments...Dolma is made up of 15 separate corpora including 2 corpora which are bucketed at higher granularity using KenLM (Heafield, 2011) perplexity."

•

Simulated Data Constraints: The paper simulates data-constrained scenarios to understand the effects of epoching, which is essential for optimizing frontier models. This involves sub-sampling datasets to mimic the behavior of training with a limited token budget.

◦

"Since training for the full 2.1T tokens in Dolma is infeasible for a large number of baselines, we instead simulate data constraints using sub-sampling."

•

UtiliMax Optimization Formulation: The UtiliMax optimization problem is specifically formulated to minimize the L2 distance between the expected utility vector of the data mix and a theoretical optimal data mix, while also considering risk and epoching caps.

◦

"UtiliMax maximizes utility by minimizing the L2 distance between the expected utility vector w⊺U of our data mix across tasks and a theoretical optimal data mix which has a utility of 1 for all tasks."

2. Key Findings & Results:

•

Token-count heuristics are strong baselines: The paper found token-count heuristics outperform manual and learned mixes.

•

UniMax as a strong baseline: UniMax, which interpolates between proportional and uniform sampling under epoching constraints, consistently outperforms other baselines in both compute-constrained and data-constrained settings.

◦

"We find UniMax (Chung et al., 2023), an approach which maximizes diversity under epoching constraints, outperforms other heuristic, manual, and learned data mixes."

•

UtiliMax improves compute efficiency: UtiliMax achieves up to a 10.6x speedup over manual baselines by incorporating utility estimates from reduced-scale ablations.

◦

"UtiliMax...achiev-ing up to a 10.6x speedup over manual baselines..."

•

MEDU reduces computational cost: MEDU matches the performance of ablation-based UtiliMax while reducing computational requirements by approximately 200x.

◦

"MEDU...matching ablation-based performance while reducing computational requirements by ∼200x."

•

Data constraints matter: Data mixing methods behave differently at different token budgets. Methods that perform well in compute-constrained settings may perform poorly in data-constrained settings, and vice-versa.

◦

"Methods behave dramatically differently at different budgets. Data mixes which are close to uniform perform well in compute-constrained settings and perform poorly in data-constrained settings, while the opposite is true for near proportional data mixes."

•

Positive Correlation of MEDU with Ground Truth Performance: MEDU demonstrates consistently strong positive correlation with ground truth performance in full mix ablations across a majority of tasks.

◦

"MEDU has consistently strong positive correlation (22/30 P < 0.01, 30/30 P < 0.05) with ground truth performance in these full mix ablations."

3. Implications & Significance:

•

Automated Data Mixing: The paper provides a framework for automated, compute-efficient data mixing that is robust across different training regimes.

◦

"Together, these approaches establish a new framework for automated, compute-efficient data mixing that is robust across training regimes."

•

Cost-Effective Utility Estimation: MEDU offers a practical way to leverage existing LLMs to estimate data utility at a significantly reduced cost, addressing the limitations of ablation-based approaches.

•

Importance of Data-Aware Training: The research emphasizes the importance of considering token-budget constraints and the effects of epoching when designing data mixing strategies, particularly for frontier models.

◦

"Data mixing experiments must consider intended token-budget...For data mixing methods to deliver predictable value, they must be tested under varied constraints."

•

Scalable Text Analysis: The work highlights the potential of scalable text analysis from LLMs to improve LLMs themselves, contributing to the growing trend of using LLMs for qualitative data analysis and metric generation.

◦

"Scalable text analysis from LLMs can improve LLMs themselves...we show that they can be combined with principled approaches which account for this to improve the models themselves."

4. Future Directions:

•

Further investigation of the limitations and potential biases of MEDU, especially regarding its tendency to assign lower scores to large web corpora.

•

Exploring more sophisticated risk estimation methods beyond the linear assumption used in UtiliMax.

•

Evaluating the performance of UtiliMax and MEDU on a wider range of LLM architectures and datasets.

•

Investigating the application of these methods to other areas of machine learning, such as fine-tuning and transfer learning.
