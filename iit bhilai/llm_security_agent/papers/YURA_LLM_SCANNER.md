This research paper introduces **YURASCANNER**, a novel web application scanner that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to perform **task-driven exploration** of web applications. Unlike traditional scanners with limited workflow understanding, YURASCANNER operates as a **goal-based agent**, using LLMs to interpret webpages and autonomously execute multi-step tasks. The authors demonstrate that this approach allows YURASCANNER to discover **deeper application states and new attack surfaces**, leading to the identification of more unique zero-day vulnerabilities compared to existing tools.
