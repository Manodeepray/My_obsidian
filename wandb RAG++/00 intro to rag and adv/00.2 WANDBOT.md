Let me introduce you to Wandbot, our very own RAG system that we'll be referencing a lot. Wandbot is like a super smart assistant that helps us with our documents.

Course chapter [notebook](https://github.com/wandb/edu/blob/main/rag-advanced/notebooks/Chapter01.ipynb) 

Here's what Wandbot does:

- **Customer Support:** It provides instant help to our users through chat and email, 24/7.
- **Internal Documentation Search**: Our teams use it to easily find information within our internal documents.
- **Developer Assistant:** It can even generate code snippets and API documentation!

My favorite thing about Wandbot is that it is open-source! You can find the code on GitHub and see how we built it. We hope this will be a valuable resource as you learn about RAG.

Wandbot is a great example of how flexible RAG systems can be. We initially built it for one purpose, but it ended up being useful in many other ways.

In this course, we'll walk you through the steps of building your own developer assistant similar to Wandbot. We'll share all the lessons we learned from building and using Wandbot in production for over 18 months. By the end, you'll be able to build your own RAG systems to solve all sorts of problems!

**Wandbot reports series** 

Creating, maintaining and upgrading Wandbot was a long journey and we like to share what worked and what did not to increase the available knowledge of actual production solutions. Each time we complete another milestone in our journey we write a technical report, here are some of them:
