**TLDR:** By focusing on the 80/20 rule, managing risks, and iterating based on feedback, we were able to create a RAG system that delivered significant benefits.

In building Wandbot, we leveraged the 80/20 rule, roughly 80% of user queries can be effectively addressed by focusing on just 20% of the available information. 

Here's how we applied the 80/20 rule:

**Focus on the essentials:** We prioritized making sure the most important 20% of our documentation was top-notch and easily accessible.

**Iterate and improve**: We started by tackling the most common problems and gradually expanded from there.

**Manage technical debt:** We balanced quick fixes with building a system that would be easy to maintain in the long run.

  

We also know that LLMs aren't perfect. They can sometimes "hallucinate" – meaning they might generate incorrect or nonsensical information. We focused on minimizing hallucinations for the most frequent queries first.

Building an AI system like Wandbot involves balancing risks and rewards.

  

**Here's how we managed risks:**

- Phased rollout: We didn't launch Wandbot all at once. We started small and gradually expanded its use.
- Addressing challenges: We found ways to deal with inaccurate responses (by adding source citations), privacy concerns (by anonymizing data), and the need for human help (by making it easy for users to contact support).

**And here are the rewards we saw:**

- Happier users: People loved getting instant and accurate answers.
- Reduced support workload: Our support team had more time to focus on complex issues.
- Global reach: Wandbot provided expert assistance to users around the world, 24/7.
