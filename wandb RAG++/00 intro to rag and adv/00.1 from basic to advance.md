	Alright, let's recap the basic RAG process first. It's like a simple question-and-answer system:

1. **Query**: A user asks a question.
2. **Retrieval**: We search our knowledge base for relevant info.
3. **Generation**: A language model uses the retrieved info and the query to create an answer.
4. **Response**: The answer is given back to the user.

But we want to go beyond the basics. We're going to build a more sophisticated RAG system. This involves adding some powerful steps:

- **Query Enhancement:** We'll make the user's question even better before searching for information. This helps us find more relevant results.
- **Retrieval (same as before):** We still search for relevant information.
- **Re-ranking:** We don't just want any relevant info, we want the most relevant info. This step helps us prioritize the best results.
- **Generation (same as before):** Our language model creates an answer using the prioritized information and the enhanced query.
- **Response Validation:** Before giving the answer to the user, we double-check it. Is it accurate? Does it make sense? Does it answer the question?
- **Response (same as before):** Finally, the answer is given to the user.

Why are these extra steps important? They help us build a RAG system that can handle tougher questions, give more accurate answers, and make the user happier with the experience.
