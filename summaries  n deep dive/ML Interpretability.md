Goal:
1. what did my model learn
2. what features/pattern from the input make the model generate certain outputs
	1. e.g. which parameters are making the language model curse 


knowing how the model thinks , allows us to :
1. debug and finetune the model
	1. why isn't my model performing well
	2. how do my choice of hyperparameter affect its learning
2. identify failure modes before deployment
	1. what are the factors that are most likely to make my model fail during production
3. increasing trust
	1. demonstrating your model is well trained so people will like it
4. discovering novel insights from data 
	1. does my model know something i don't
