- **Blogs:** Several blogs are dedicated to making AI/ML accessible. Look for blogs by reputable organizations like [DeepLearning.AI](http://DeepLearning.AI), which has a section on "Papers for Beginners" [[community.deeplearning.ai](http://community.deeplearning.ai)]

**Tips for Choosing Papers:**

- **Focus on concepts:** As a beginner, it's more important to grasp core concepts than dive into complex algorithms. Look for papers that explain core ideas like linear regression, decision trees, or k-nearest neighbors in an accessible way.
- **Consider accompanying materials:** Some papers have tutorials or code implementations available online. These resources can be immensely helpful in understanding and replicating the research. Look for papers with these resources mentioned in the acknowledgements section or through a quick web search.

**Finding Code Implementations:**

- **GitHub repositories:** Many researchers share their code on platforms like GitHub. You can find repositories related to specific papers by searching for the paper title or keywords.
